# Netflix Clone
Welcome to my Netflix Clone repository! This project is a simple replica of the popular streaming service, created using only HTML and CSS.

## Features
A responsive layout that looks great on any device
Custom fonts and color scheme to give the site a unique look and feel
A navigation menu with links to different sections of the site
A main content area with cards featuring popular movies and TV shows
## Future Plans
While this project is currently a basic replica of Netflix, I have several ideas for future updates and improvements:

Add the ability to play videos on the site
Implement a search bar to allow users to easily find specific movies or TV shows
Create a login system to allow users to create their own lists of favorite titles
Add more content, such as reviews and ratings for each title
## How to Use
To view this project on your own computer, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.

I hope you enjoy using my Netflix Clone! If you have any suggestions for improvements or find any bugs, please feel free to open an issue in the repository..
